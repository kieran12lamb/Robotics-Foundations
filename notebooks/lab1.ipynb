    "## ROS in a nutshell!\n",
    "The main aim of ROS is **to provide operating system-like functionalities for specialised robotic agents, under an open-source license**. The creators based ROS around five fundamental design principles: peer-to-peer, tools-based, multi-lingual, thin, and open-source. It currently supports four languages: C++, Python, Octave and LISP with other language ports in development. To be language-independent, ROS uses a language-neutral interface definition language to define messages sent between modules. So, the services it offers are similar to the ones found in most software middleware (like Django in WAD2!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware abstraction, which enables the development of portable code which can interface with a large number of robot platforms\n",
    "- Low-level device control, facilitating robotic control\n",
    "- Inter-process communication via message passing\n",
    "- Software package management, which ensures the framework is easily extensible\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, at the core of all the programs running on ROS is an anonymised form of the publisher-subscriber pattern. Processes are termed **nodes** in ROS, as they form part of an underlying graph (Figure 1) that keeps track of nodes (via the graph resource name, a unique identifier) and all the communications between them at a fine-grained scale. Since most robotic systems are assumed to comprise numerous components, all requiring control or I/O services, the ROS node architecture expects that each computation is delegated to a separate node, thus reducing the complexity involved in developing monolithic control systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ros_graph.png](imgs/ros_graph.png)\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><b>Figure 1: Example of a ROS node graph</b><br></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of using ROS is that it allows debugging of a node in active development alongside working nodes, due to the modular structure. It also means people working in robotics do not have to reinvent the wheel for each project and software developed for robots can be easily shared creating a vibrant community. Additionally, all other nodes can be started and left running, and developers can just edit and restart the one node they are working on. As the system gets more complex this can be incredibly beneficial ([http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/icraoss09-ROS.pdf](http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/icraoss09-ROS.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Newly-created nodes can communicate in one of three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topics\n",
    "- RPC Services\n",
    "- Parameter Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common communication mechanism involves transmitting and receiving messages asynchronously on a strongly-typed named bus or log called a **topic**. Nodes can create, publish or subscribe to a topic, and send and receive data in the form of messages of a predefined type, at a set frequency measured in Hz. Built for unidirectional streaming communication topics also benefit from anonymous publish/subscribe semantics, thus removing communicating nodes’ awareness of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in cases where the many-to-many transport provided by topics is not appropriate, ROS offers a form of node interaction based on the request/reply paradigm of remote procedure calls. These **services** are defined by a pair of messages, of which one is the request sent to a node, and the other is the reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parameter server** takes the form of a globally-viewable dictionary of typically static, non-binary data points. The server is designed primarily for the storage of shared configuration parameters, and does not uphold any premise of high performance and thus should not be seen as a global variable store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above 3 communication types support the smooth integration of custom user code within a ROS ecosystem and unify the different APIs that would typically be needed to access relevant system information (sensor data, actuator positions, etc.)."

    "Similar to an operating system, a ROS workspace is divided into folders, and these folders have files that describe their functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Packages**: Packages form the atomic level of ROS. A package has the minimum structure and content to create a program within ROS. It may have ROS runtime processes (nodes), configuration files, and so on. In the following sections, you will create a ROS package.\n",
    "* **Package manifests**: Package manifests provide information about a package, licenses, dependencies, compilation flags, and so on. A package manifest is managed with a file called package.xml.\n",
    "* **Metapackages**: When you want to aggregate several packages in a group, you will use meta-packages. In ROS, there exists a lot of these meta-packages; for example, the navigation software stack.\n",
    "* **Metapackage manifests**: Metapackage manifests ( package.xml ) are similar to a normal package, but with an export tag in XML. It also has certain restrictions in its structure.\n",
    "* **Message (msg) types**: A message is the information that a process sends to other processes. ROS has a lot of standard types of messages. Message descriptions are stored in my_package/msg/MyMessageType.msg.\n",
    "* **Service (srv) types**: Service descriptions, stored in my_package/srv/MyServiceType.srv, define the request and response data structures for services provided by each process in ROS."

    "To develop ROS robots, you usually create a workspace where you will store ROS packages and related configurations and files. In general terms, the workspace is a folder tree that contains packages, those packages include your source files, and the environment or workspace provides us with a way to compile those packages. It is useful when you want to compile various packages at the same time, and it is a good way of centralising all of your developments.\n",

To save on cost, sadly, the Turtlebot does not have a real laser scanner. It does, however, have a Kinect depth camera, and the Turtlebot software stack extracts the middle rows of the Kinect’s depth image, does a bit of filtering, and then publishes the data as [`sensor_msgs/LaserScan`](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html) messages on the `/scan` topic. This means that from the standpoint of the high-level software, the data shows up exactly like “real” laser scans on more expensive robots.

    "## Working with Services\n",
    "Services, as explained in previous sections, are RPC calls within the ROS ecosystem. For the purpose of this lab, let's create a service that queries the current range reading and the status of the robot (whether it is driving forward or turning) and allows to change the status of the robot on-the-fly. The first thing is that you need to create a new directory within your `myturtlebot` package called `srv`, so open a console and type (alternatively, you can use jupyter to create the folder and the service file):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd ~/robot_ws/src/myturtlebot\n",
    "mkdir srv\n",
    "cd srv\n",
    "touch TurtlebotStatus.srv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, open `TurtlebotStatus.srv` with a text editor (i.e. `vi`, `nano` or in jupyter) and add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "bool forwardrqst\n",
    "---\n",
    "float32 range\n",
    "bool forwardresp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[ROS Services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services) are similar to ROS topics and messages; the main difference is the `---` separation between declarations. The part above is the *request* whereas the part below is the *response* - messages have the part above only. After defining your service, you need to tell ROS that it needs to compile it and do the required plumbing so you can access it within your python script. To do this, open `package.xml` in your `myturtlebot` package and add the next two lines in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` xml\n",
    "<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>\n",
    "<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then, you need to add the `message_generation` dependency to generate messages in `CMakeLists.txt`, so open this file and add `message_generation` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS\n",
    "  geometry_msgs\n",
    "  rospy\n",
    "  sensor_msgs\n",
    "  message_generation\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, find the `add_service_files` CMake directive in `CMakeLists.txt`, uncomment/replace with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "add_service_files(\n",
    "    FILES\n",
    "    TurtlebotStatus.srv\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and, the same for:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "   DEPENDENCIES\n",
    "   geometry_msgs\n",
    "   sensor_msgs\n",
    "   std_msgs\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`generate_messages` will tell `catkin_make` to generate code for use in all supported languages in ROS, in your case, you will use the Python variant. Finally, let's compile and add it to ROS path! So in a console, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd ~/robot_ws\n",
    "catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash\n",
